# learning_rust
This repository will be my 2nd attempt to learn Rust. With the  push from the  White House, NSA and CISA to move to memory safe programming languages, I feel its a good time to dive back into Rust while I learn memory management in C simultaneously. 

Interestingly from the time  of the announcement to now (about a year) Rust has gained 4 spots (#18 -> #14) and on its move to the top 10 in the Tiobe ranking.
